# FitFoks Research Proposal

## -Rushabh Patel

## Project Motivation

Following the development of the Course Goals and App Design Journal assignments I have identified the following as a potential app that I would like to learn how to build:

>### FitFolks
> The app will provide data for people who wish to do exercises and look after their health. I believe that fitness is one of the major problems that our society is facing. I feel that a fitness app could motivate a lot of people to get on track. My main goal for this course is to create an app that uses the DRY or don't repeat yourself principle. I've tried to look over these in javascript and was a bit sucessfull, however I feel that developing IOS apps require higher level of complexities. An app that works on the principle of DRY and the apple's guidelines for creating app would be mine ideal endgame for this course.

## Comparative analysis
During my research I came across many different fitness applications, but I've selected the following two to review in my comperative analysis.

- Apple Fitness+ - Apple fitness is an application that stands out as it is the best fitness app the app store has to offer. According to apple "Apple Fitness+ is a subscription service that gives you access to trainer-guided workout videos on your compatible iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV. ... In-session, you can see your heart rate and Activity Rings onscreen. Workouts range from 5 to 45 minutes in length, and new content is added weekly". Its advantages are:
  - Conveniently timed workouts for every schedule (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 minute options)
  - Diversity among instructors
  - Workouts are accessible (instructors offer modifications and use sign language)
  - Large collection of over 1,000 workouts within different exercise categories
  - Competitive pricing
  - Ability to share membership with family members through family sharing
 
- 7 minute workout - 7 minute workout is an application that provides users with workout options that are high intensity and are not very time consuming.Its advantages are:
  - Time-efficient
  - Easy to fit into most schedules
  - Great for beginners
  - Non-intimidating
  - Cardio fitness gains
  
## Key features
### Device features

- Touchscreen
- Speakers

### User interface features

- Main screen - It will contain the list of different types of workouts. It will have tiles that represent different exercises with images and labels.
- Exercise screen - It will have detailed information about that particular exercise. It will include a name of the exercise, the amount of calories it could burn, it's length. It might include a video of an instructor doing the exercise, I'm not quite sure about it,as I might have issues getting the video of the instructor.

### Learning Goals

I would like to learn how to create apps in IOS and I would also like to learn how to build reusabel components in the app. During my research I found that companies mainly work on frameworks and build their architecture around reusabel code. I would like to explore this avenue with IOS development.

### Loose timeline 
- Milestone 1: Have all research complete. Have read / watched all resources listed above and have completed any related tutorials. Try to create a base version of the app that features multiple screen and goes over multiple screen.
- Milestone 2: Have produced code to work through reusable class. I would like to have a class or an app that uses the class to work on the reusabel code. As DRY is my main research element.
- Milestone 3: Have produced MVP code for the FitFoks application
